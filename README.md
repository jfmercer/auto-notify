# auto-notify
Uses Gulp to trigger automatic testing notifications on Mac

## PHPSpec
This Gulpfile is configured for testing with PHPSpec. If you want to use a different testing package, you will have to modify the Gulpfile accordingly. Specifically, ````gulp-phpspec```` will have to be replaced by your chosen testing tool. This also applies to package.json.
